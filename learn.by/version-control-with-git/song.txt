Looking back across the years
the good times and the bad
all echo in my mind
Whispered on a breeze
sweet and bitter memories
of all I left behind

If it wasn't for your love
I don't know where I'd be
I don't know what I'd do
Time and time again
sing the same refrain
It's all because of you

For you will be my love
and I will feel your heartbeat
forevermore
Rest here in my arms
Forevermore

Thro' the dark night of my soul
you gave me a hand to hold
and help me make it trho'
Now all my doubts and all my fears
I held inside for all those years
dissappear when I'm with you

For you will be my love
and I will feel your heartbeat
forevermore
Rest here in my arms

Give me all your love
give me all your love
and I'll be in your loving arms
forevermore


For you will be my love
and I will feel your heartbeat
forevermore
Rest here in my arms

Give me all your love
give me all your love
and I'll be in your loving arms
give me all your love

Forevermore
